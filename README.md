# Python-Web-Scraping
Web scraping example from Alex the Analyst Python tutorial. The webpage being scraped is a publicly available webpage of top companies by revenue in the united states.
The page has 3 tables, so I used indexing to access the particulat table data I wanted to scrape, and then exported it into a CSV file on my local PC.
